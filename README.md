# Climbing World
#### https://climbing-world.herokuapp.com/

### An app to showcase climbing routes from around the world! Uses the Mountain Project API to list climbing routes with their locations, descriptions, and ratings.
#### Built with Ruby on Rails, with Bootstrap on the frontend. Looking to recreate this project with a Node.js backend and React on the frontend.

* In order to setup this project, fork it to your own repo, then clone it down.
* Uses Ruby 2.4.1 and Rails 5.1.2
* Once cloned:
  * Run `bundle`
  * Create database with `rake db:create`
  * Run migrations `rake db:migrate`
  * Populate the database `rake db:seed`
